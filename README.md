# The Dominic Helping Repository

**The assignment im currently stuck on is:**

**Perameters:**

- In Working mode, keep calling coding().

- In Asleep mode, keep calling the screensaver function which corresponds to the last gesture detected, or the default.

--rain() for TiltLeft.

--freqBars() for TiltRight.

**Issues I'm having:**

- coding() will not stop executing with a while(true) function in it but runs inncorrectly if replaced with a basic(forever)

- Button input seems to work to turn off the program but won't execute coding() again when turned back on.

- Gestures do execute rain() or freqBars()
